  abstract = {The electric-pump cycle is a configuration in which an electric motor powers the pumps in a rocket engine  instead of a turbine found in conventional engine configurations. This has several advantages among which  are simpler design, cheaper development, no need for intricate pump seals, and easy restartability. These  advantages come at the cost of performance, as identified by previous research. However, detailed analysis  of the electric-pump cycle's performance has mainly compared this cycle with the gas generator cycle and  only for equal inputs, while individual cycles might have different optimal inputs. Furthermore, the main  technologies used in the electric-pump cycle, i.e. electric motors and batteries, have been improving in the  past decades and this improvement is even accelerating with the advent of the electric car. Therefore, this  research set out to define the current performance of the electric-pump cycle in the context of conventional  cycles and predict the performance it will have in the future.  To this end a modular rocket cycle analysis tool, called RoCAT, has been built, which combines ideal rocket  theory and previous research to analyze the electric-pump, gas generator, and open expander cycle in a broad  design space for several propellants and configurations. It was verified and validated by comparing it to en-  gine designs, engine simulations, and existing engines. The performance of all cycles was found to be mod-  eled quite accurately with room for improvement in the modeling of pressure drops and heat transfer. The  mass model was found to severely underestimate the engine dry mass, which makes the mass modeling of  RoCAT unsuited for calculating absolute values, but this inaccuracy was accepted for this research as it is only  needed for comparative purposes.  Following this determination for accuracy RoCAT was used to compare the cycles over a broad range of thrust  levels, burn times, and chamber pressures. It was found that the electric-pump cycle performs worse than the  gas generator and open expander for all considered performance parameters, i.e. initial mass, specific im-  pulse, mass ratio and velocity change. This in line with previous research with the exception of initial mass.  Previous research found the initial mass of the electric-pump cycle engine to be lower than that of the gas  generator cycle for burn times above 390 seconds, which was not confirmed by this research. Subsequently,  the cycles were compared for selected thrust and burn times with optimized chamber pressure and mixture  ratio. The electric pump cycle was found to have a velocity change that is 9.4-9.9\% lower than that of the  gas generator and 7.7-8.4\% lower than the open expander cycle ,respectively. With the smaller difference  corresponding to higher burn times and vice versa. Additionally, the optimal chamber pressure was found  to be around only 15 bar irrespective of burn time. Unlike the conventional cycles whose optimal chamber  pressure does change with burn time. The differences in optimal mixture ratio were found to be almost com-  pletely dependent on the differences in optimal chamber pressure.  Finally, the development trends for batteries and electric motors were used to approximate the future perfor-  mance of the electric-pump cycle. It was estimated that it will still take several decades for the electric-pump  cycle to match the performance of the conventional cycles. Electric motor specific power will need to in-  crease by two orders of magnitude, while battery specific energy will need to at least double. In conclusion:  Despite continuous expected improvement, breakthroughs in both electric motor and battery technology are  required to bring the performance of the electric-pump cycle on par with the turbine driven cycles.},

The development of the pumps is a part of the work carried out to develop an Electric Propellant Pump System (EPPS) for the storable propellant monomethyl hydrazine (MMH) and nitrogen tetraoxide (NTO). Supporting technology development has been funded by the Swedish Delegation for Space Activities (DFR) and Swedish Space Corporation (SSC) together with Volvo Flygmotor. The main advantages of a typical EPPS communication satellite application are weight and volume reduction of the propellant system compared with a pressure-fed system. Active engine mixture ratio control and improved propellant utilization are also possible. Refuelling in space is another potential application where EPPS can be used. The development work was focused on communication satellite apogee propulsion and used the MBB 3 kN engine as reference. This paper presents the pump design and analyses and the results from the test campaigns of three different pump configurations, carried out with water as test liquid. The head rise, efficiency and suction performance together with other characteristics are also given. The planned next development step is to demonstrate pump performance in the propellants and primarily in NTO. The step is funded by (DFR)/(SSC) together with Volvo Flygmotor.}

In tests performed at room temperature, the flow was modulated from 980 mL/min. with the valve fully open (0 V), to 0 mL/min. with 60 V actuation, at an inlet pressure of 55 kPa. Cryogenic flow rate tests show similar modulation with flow from 166 mL/min. with the valve fully open, to 5.3 mL/min. with 120 V actuation voltage, at an inlet pressure of 70 kPa. The platinum RTD temperature sensor is independently tested from 40-450 K with sensitivity of 0.23\%/K in its operational range of 150450 K.

One of the most important components of the rocket engine for thrust control is the propellant injection system. The pintle injector is one of the most promising candidates due to its simple structure and combustion stability. However, the number of studies on the pintle injector is limited and detailed phenomena of the pintle injector has not been clarified. Therefore, a combustion test using an ethanol/ liquid oxygen rocket engine is carried out with a planar pintle injector in a rectangular combustor. Fundamental combustion characteristics such as characteristic exhaust velocity efficiency are acquired at the combustion pressure of 0.45 MPa and O/F=1.25 to 1.80. C* efficiency increases as the equivalence ratio increases up to unity. Flame images during combustion at 0.45 MPa and O/F=1.75 were acquired. Luminous flame was not observed in throughout all of the region except for the vicinity of the faceplate. However, strong luminous flame was observed at the time of ignition. The combustion chamber used in this research can simulate one of the recirculation zones observed in actual combustor with pintletype injectors, which contributes to the combustion stability. However, the recirculation zone formed at the top of the injector is not simulated appropriately due to the existence of the lower wall of the combustor.},
